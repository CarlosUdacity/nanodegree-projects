In more details:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The SVM takes data about previous students (age, gender, family, etc), and uses them to create a function that draws a boundary between the students who passed and those who didn't. The distance between the boundary and the nearest students from either set (the ones who passed vs the ones who didn't) is known as the margin. The goal is to choose a boundary with the greatest possible margin between the boundary and any student within the set, giving a greater chance of new students being classified correctly.\n",

    "![alt text](http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/graphics/SVMIntro3.gif)\n",
